The data set obtained from Kaggle, titled as Netflix Movies and TV Shows, was cleaned and transformed using Power Query Editor in PowerBI. The excel version I have is 2019, and lots of tools were missing, so I made use of PowerBI.

The following tasks were done as a part of data cleaning : 

1. Removed Duplicates
2. Changed Data Types
3. Replaced Blank values with NaN (Considering the entire data was crucial, nothing was deleted)
4. Removed Errors
